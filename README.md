# 6.1120 Skeleton Code

This repository hosts the skeleton code for 6.1120, a class for building a virtual machine for a Python-like language called MITScript.

## Setup

### Dependencies

If you're not using the virtual machine, install the following dependencies:

```
sudo apt install git build-essential default-jre 

# faster CMake backend for faster builds
sudo apt install ninja-build

# to help with debugging
sudo apt install valgrind
```


### Virtual Machine

Here is an Ubuntu 22.04 (LTS) virtual machine with these dependencies already installed:
[link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kr1b8pTCcWag4sDHVnenqPYmEgCJgLYU/view?usp=sharing).

#### Docker

If you want to use Docker instead of the virtual machine, you should:
1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. Download the docker image
```sh
docker pull lgovedic/mit-61120:0.1
```
3. Start a docker container.
```sh
docker run -it --rm --cap-add=SYS_PTRACE --security-opt seccomp=unconfined --name=61120 --mount type=bind,source=${PWD},target=/src lgovedic/mit-61120:0.1 bash
```
This will start the container, map the current repository in it, and
finally pull up a shell inside the container.
Once the shell starts, just write commands like you were using a regular
Limux terminal.

```sh
root@221b746bd366:/# cd src
root@221b746bd366:/src# cmake ... # or  make ...
```

### Updating

To pull updates from this repository, go to your own repository, and run:

```sh
# only do this once
git remote add upstream git@github.com:mit-61120/61120-fa22.git

# do this every time the skeleton repository is updated
git pull upstream main
```

## Build and run
### Build
The `build.sh` script will be used for building when grading,
so you should make sure it can build your code.
A `build.sh` is provided for you if you're planning to use CMake -
otherwise, you should modify it to fit your needs. 

You can also use the script to build the code locally, or you can
run the commands directly as described below.
#### CMake
If you'd like to learn more about CMake, you can read the first
few chapters of the [tutorial](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/guide/tutorial/index.html).
If you have more questions, ask on Piazza!

To avoid starting every build from scratch, you can run the CMake build commands directly.

```sh
# This is called the configuration step and it prepares the build system inside cmake-build-grading.
# Rerun only if you modify CMake files.
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -S . -B cmake-build-grading

# This performs the incremental build, run when modifying .h/.cpp files,
# or after the command above.
cmake --build cmake-build-grading

```

This will put the executables inside `cmake-build-grading/interpreter/*`.
You can use the symlinks that `build.sh` creates, but you don't have to.

##### Further customization
CMake has a lot of customization options. E.g. to compile without optimization
and with debugging symbols, do the following:
```sh
# we can keep multiple builds around with different options by 
# storing them in separate directories. 
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -S . -B cmake-build-debug
cmake --build cmake-build-debug
```

If you want to add compile options or flags, use:
- [target_compile_options](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_options.html) 
- [target_compile_definitions](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/target_compile_definitions.html)
- etc.

Make sure you're looking at documentation for your version of CMake (`cmake --version`).

If you want to run with the Ninja backend for better compilation speed,
specify it with the `-G` option during the configuration step;
```sh
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -G Ninja -S . -B cmake-build-debug

# build step stays the same, just make sure Ninja is installed.
```
##### Tests
By default, tests won't build.
To build them, add `-D BUILD_TESTS=ON` (before the `-S` flag) to the configure step:
```sh
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -D BUILD_TESTS=ON -S . -B cmake-build-debug
```

#### Make
Uncomment line 2 of `build.sh`, and you're all set. To run directly,
just run `make` inside the `interpreter` directory. 

Tests are not currently supported when using make.

#### IDEs (CLion, Visual Studio Code, etc.)

These will usually work with CMake right out of the box.
Ask on Piazza if you have trouble connecting your IDE to the build system.
### Run

Whether your parser is inside `interpreter/` or `cmake-build-*/interpreter`, invoke it as such:

```sh
[path/to/executable]/mitscript-parser [path/to/input/file]
```

#### Tests

To run parser unit tests:

- Create a test file (like `test/interpreter/example-test.cpp`)
- Add the test file to the correct target in CMakeLists.txt
- Build the tests (described above)
- Run the tests:
```sh
cmake-build-debug/test/interpreter/parser-tests [flags]
```
